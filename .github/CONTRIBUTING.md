# Contributing Guidelines

Firstly, thank you for you interest in contributing to this project! Our contributors are what help keep the project going so a big thank you for considering to contribute ‚ù§

First and foremost, we value our community and we would like to keep everything as pleasant as possible. This means that, if contributors do not abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), they will not be allowed to continue to work on the project. Please make sure you have read through the code of conduct and that you understand everything. If you have any questions, feel free to join our [Discord server](http://discord.cascadebot.org/)!

We recommend you join our [Discord server](https://discord.cascadebot.org/) when contributing in order to receive any help or support you may need!

## ü§ñ JDA
This project uses the popular [JDA library](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) as its base. Please make sure you are familiar with the library in order to make sure simple issues are ironed out before a PR is made! The [JDA documentation](https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA/javadoc/index.html?overview-summary.html) and the [JDA Wiki](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/wiki) are very helpful when it comes to learning about the ins and outs of the library.

## üìö Contributing Guidelines
 - Behave respectfully towards other people on issues and PRs; we will not tolerate any unwelcome behaviour.
 - When reporting an issue, be as complete as possible! Make sure you can replicate the issue and post all screenshots and stack traces you acquire during testing.

## üìñ Development Guidelines
 - Make yourself familiar with our codebase! We value consistency for Cascade and we may request changes in order to keep with the rest of the codebase. Also make sure you are familiar with our [code style](https://github.com/CascadeBot/CascadeBot/wiki/Code-Style) and [repository structure](https://github.com/CascadeBot/CascadeBot/wiki/Repository-Structure)!
 - **Do not** contribute random features. Not only is this a waste of our time, it is a waste of your time also. Any random features that do not fit in with the current stage of the project will be rejected. We encourage any contributors to look through [other PRs](https://github.com/CascadeBot/CascadeBot/pulls) and [our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/CascadeBot/projects/3) for ideas! 
 - Make sure you are following standard Java conventions for Java 11.
 - If someone is already developing on an idea and you want to extend it, try suggesting on that same PR instead of making your own. Alternatively, you could speak with the author of the feature and see if you can make a PR to the feature on their repository. This will mean that all the changes will get merged in one PR to our repository.
 - If your PR is not complete, open a [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) instead of a regular one.
